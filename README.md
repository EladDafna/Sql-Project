# SQL Project

## Overview

This project involves the creation, management, and querying of a relational database using SQL. The project demonstrates the ability to design a database schema, populate it with data, and perform complex queries to retrieve and manipulate data. The database and SQL queries are designed to handle real-world scenarios, focusing on optimizing performance and ensuring data integrity.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several files and directories, each serving a specific purpose:
- **SQL Scripts:** These scripts are used to create the database schema, populate the database with initial data, and run various queries to demonstrate the functionality.
- **Documentation:** Includes explanations of the database schema, the relationships between different tables, and descriptions of the queries performed.

## Steps and Solutions

### 1. Database Schema Design

- The project begins by designing a relational database schema that includes multiple tables. Each table is carefully structured to represent entities relevant to the scenario being modeled. Relationships between the tables, such as one-to-many and many-to-many relationships, are defined using primary and foreign keys.

### 2. Data Insertion

- After the schema is created, data is inserted into the tables. The data represents realistic scenarios and is used to test the functionality and efficiency of the queries. The insertion is done using SQL `INSERT` statements, and care is taken to maintain data integrity and consistency across the tables.

### 3. Complex Queries

- The project includes a series of complex SQL queries that demonstrate various operations such as data retrieval, filtering, aggregation, and joining of tables. These queries are designed to solve real-world problems and provide insights into the data stored in the database. The queries include the use of `JOIN` operations, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and nested subqueries.

### 4. Performance Optimization

- The project also addresses the optimization of SQL queries for better performance. Indexes are created on specific columns to speed up query execution, and the impact of these optimizations is analyzed and documented. The project emphasizes the importance of writing efficient SQL code to handle large datasets effectively.

### 5. Data Integrity and Constraints

- To ensure data integrity, various constraints are applied to the database schema. These include `NOT NULL` constraints, `UNIQUE` constraints, and `CHECK` constraints. The use of foreign keys ensures that relationships between tables are maintained, and cascading actions are defined to handle deletions and updates.

### Repository Structure

- **SQL_Scripts:** Contains all the SQL scripts used to create the schema, insert data, and run queries.
- **Documentation:** Contains detailed explanations of the schema design, the rationale behind the chosen structure, and descriptions of the queries and optimizations performed.

### Usage Instructions

To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Use a SQL-compatible database management system (DBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server to execute the SQL scripts.
3. Run the schema creation script first to set up the database structure.
4. Populate the database with data using the data insertion script.
5. Execute the query scripts to retrieve and analyze the data.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the practical application of SQL in database management, from schema design to data manipulation and performance optimization. By working through the different steps, users can gain a deeper understanding of how to build and interact with a relational database in a real-world context.
